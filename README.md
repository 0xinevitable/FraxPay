# ¬§ FraxPay by Inevitable

**FraxPay** was built during the **Hackathon [FraxBuild 2023](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/fraxbuild/track) under the Consumer Adoption Track**, enabling merchants and content creators to accept payments in Frax Stablecoins seamlessly. We have integrated Fraxswap into our smart contract-based payment gateway, thereby providing the option for users to pay with any token.

1. Payment Gateway (Done‚úÖ, Deployed to üî¥Optimism Mainnet) integrated with Fraxswap (WIP, Specs Present)
2. Dashboard
3. Payment Links with Easy-to-use Customer Onboarding
4. Frontend Widgets/SDK for FraxPay and Fraxswap

## For Merchants

> Accept **Frax Stablecoins** with Ease, Simplify Payments with **Instant Payment Links**

In just a few seconds, you can generate payment links and start accepting cryptocurrency for your products. **For this hackathon, we limited the base token to FRAX.** However, its _contract is **versatile** and can accommodate Native Tokens, such as ETH, as well as any ERC20 Token._

First, input your product information(This example features the AirPods Max case from [artifact.supply](https://artifact.supply)). Then, add the price along with the necessary user information required for shipping and management.

As a merchant, you'll need to log in with your wallet. We implemented web3 Auth using [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org). Once logged in, you can generate payment information with no additional fees. This information is sent to an API which, in return, provides a `productID` associated with the created document. The IDs are not sequential and are designed to be URL-friendly, made possible by [nanoid](https://github.com/ai/nanoid/).

**Given our use of the stablecoin FRAX, we aim to establish a mental equivalence for users that 1 FRAX equals 1 USD. To further reinforce this concept, we have hidden the token symbol and replaced it with the dollar sign(`$`) and logo.**
